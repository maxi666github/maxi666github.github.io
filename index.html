                    <p>Hey there! Are you curious about <em>Welcome Home</em> but have no idea where to start looking for information? Did you try looking elsewhere, only to find the most reliable resources being swallowed up by obtrusive ads or locked behind a Discord invite? Then you're in luck! This is a fanmade wiki dedicated to providing fans and newcomers alike with everything there is to know about <em><a href="https://www.welcomehomerestorationproject.net/">Welcome Home</a></em>, a multimedia horror project by <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/partycoffin">Partycoffin</a> (Coffin-Festival on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/coffin-festival.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>). This site isn’t meant to be a replica of any other existing wiki for <em>Welcome Home</em>, but I hope it’s a fun, informative, and accessible read nonetheless.</p>

                  <em>"Welcome Home is an experimental multi-media horror project that focuses on unraveling the mystery surrounding a beloved 1970s children’s television show. You are to accompany a colorful cavalcade of puppets as their beloved neighborhood begins to skew and distort into a nightmarish memory that they can barely recall. Through illustrated books, recordings, and an array of old merchandise, you will find what dwells within this colorful home! Beneath its beautiful carpets, behind its gorgeous wallpaper, and deep within its breathing crevices! Fortunately, you have someone to keep you company and hold your hand as you walk down a path now long forgotten."</em>
